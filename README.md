This is the base code for a Super Mario Bros simulator for which we will be implementing an evolutionary controller to play the game.


# Getting Started #

### Installing IntelliJ ###

As the base code for this assignment was written in Java, the first thing we need to do is install a Java IDE!

If you do not already have a student Jetbrains account, head to here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students and then click Apply Now, then go through the application with your Monash Student Email, then you should have access to the entire Jetbrains suite, including IntelliJ!

Once that’s done, head to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ and click Download to begin installing IntelliJ, following the prompts as directed.


### Clone This Base Code ###

The base code for this work is a slightly modified version of https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework

We will be storing this base code on the following repository: https://bitbucket.org/shortestpathlab/mario_ai_students/src/main/ so that in case there are any updates to the base code (which there shouldn’t be) it will be easy to roll them out.

Clone the above repository to wherever you would like on your own device, using whichever Git client (or the terminal) that you prefer using.

### How Do I Start The Game? ###

**Open IntelliJ** and then Select **Open** and then navigate to the directory where you cloned the base code. Specifically make sure you open the directory that contains the **img**, **levels**, and **src** folders.

With that, open up **src->PlayLevel** and then hit the **Play** button in the top right of the screen, this should start level 1-1 with an AI controller which you can find in **src->agents->EAController->Agent**

The controls are:

- **Left:** Left Arrow Key
- **Right:** Right Arrow Key
- **Down:** Down Arrow Key
- **Speed:** A
- **Jump:** S

Have some fun watching the AI speedrunning the level!!
